## Student Numbers

Student numbers are supported in the Report interface, and are provisioned through LDAP using the CandidateDetailProvider in Kernel.

### useInstitutionalNumericID
This is a boolean value, which defaults to false and controls whether student numbers are enabled system wide.

### certification.extraUserProperties.enable
This is a boolean value, whose default is false, which controls whether or not student numbers are enabled.

`certification.extraUserProperties.enable = true`

# Conversion (Users of versions older than 12.0)
Due to the tool refactor, some tables were renamed and some classes were refactored, a conversion script is required to make it work in the 12.x version and newer.

The table **cert_field_mapping** was renamed to **certificate_field_mapping** for consistency reasons:

```
ALTER TABLE cert_field_mapping RENAME TO certificate_field_mapping;
```

Some classes were refactored, update the classes of the **certificate_criterion** table: 

```
UPDATE certificate_criterion SET type = 'org.sakaiproject.certification.api.criteria.gradebook.GreaterThanScoreCriterion' where type = 'com.rsmart.certification.impl.hibernate.criteria.gradebook.GreaterThanScoreCriterionHibernateImpl';

UPDATE certificate_criterion SET type = 'org.sakaiproject.certification.api.criteria.gradebook.WillExpireCriterion' where type = 'com.rsmart.certification.impl.hibernate.criteria.gradebook.WillExpireCriterionHibernateImpl';

UPDATE certificate_criterion SET type = 'org.sakaiproject.certification.api.criteria.gradebook.FinalGradeScoreCriterion' where type = 'com.rsmart.certification.impl.hibernate.criteria.gradebook.FinalGradeScoreCriterionHibernateImpl';

UPDATE certificate_criterion SET type = 'org.sakaiproject.certification.api.criteria.gradebook.DueDatePassedCriterion' where type = 'com.rsmart.certification.impl.hibernate.criteria.gradebook.DueDatePassedCriterionHibernateImpl';
```

The tool id has been changed for consistency:
```
UPDATE sakai_site_tool SET registration = 'sakai.certification' WHERE registration = 'com.rsmart.certification';
```
